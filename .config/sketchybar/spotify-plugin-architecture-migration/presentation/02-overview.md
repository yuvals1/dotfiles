# What We Implemented

## Architecture Migration: From Complexity to Simplicity

1. **Multi-Script Distributed System (Before)**  
  - 6+ specialized scripts handling different functions
  - File-based state coordination and process management
  - Event-driven spawning of individual processes

2. **Unified State Machine (After)**  
  - Single infinite loop daemon handling all functionality
  - In-memory state management with 5 FPS tick rate
  - Command queue interface for external integration

3. **Key Features Preserved + Enhanced**  
  - ✅ Real-time UI updates (artwork, progress, context)
  - ✅ 4-state radio cycling with real Spotify API calls
  - ✅ Force-repeat functionality (now in-memory)
  - ✅ Keyboard shortcuts and view state management
  - ✅ Seek commands and all original controls

## Result: **6+ scripts → 1 daemon** with better performance and reliability
