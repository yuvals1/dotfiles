# The Problem in Simple Terms

## What Was Actually Happening

### **The User Experience:**
"I press Alt+R to toggle radio mode"

### **What Happened Behind the Scenes (Before):**
```
1. Sketchybar launches a new script
2. That script checks if another script is running
3. If not, it launches another script  
4. That script reads a file to see what mode we're in
5. It calculates the next mode
6. It launches yet another script to change the mode
7. That script finally talks to Spotify
8. Then it writes the new mode to a file
9. Meanwhile, other scripts are reading/writing the same files
10. UI updates... eventually... maybe
```

### **The Core Issue:**
- **6 different programs** trying to coordinate through **text files**
- Like having 6 people in different rooms communicating by leaving notes on a shared bulletin board
- Someone might read an old note, two people might pin notes at the same time, notes get lost

### **What Happens Now (After):**
```
1. You press Alt+R
2. A single program that's always running sees the command
3. It changes the radio mode and updates the UI
4. Done.
```

### **The Solution:**
- **1 program** that remembers everything in its head
- Like having 1 person managing everything with a perfect memory
- No miscommunication, no lost notes, instant response

## **In One Sentence:**
We replaced a chaotic office of 6 people passing notes with a single efficient assistant who handles everything.
